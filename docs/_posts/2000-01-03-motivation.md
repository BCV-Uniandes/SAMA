#### Multimodal Analysis

Even though previous methods use multimodal information, they do not consider the anatomical spatial elationship familiar to radiologists, such as the existing correlation between finding nodules in multiple locations and the cancer stage. We believe the LUng CAncer Screening with Multimodal Biomarkers (LUCAS) [(Daza et al., 2020)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-60946-7_12) dataset is a promising experimentalframework, for it is the first that provides clinical information considered by physicians in addition to chest CT scans.

In this paper we  propose a method that exploits multimodal data by spatially combining visual and clinical information to predict a patientâ€™s probability of having lung cancer.
