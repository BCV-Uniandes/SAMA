#### Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is the deadliest cancer worldwide [(American Cancer Society, 2020)](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/lung-cancer/about/key-statistics.html). Diagnosis requires highly specialized physicians and is prone to errors due to the hard-to-see nodules, from which nearly 35% are missed in initial screenings [(E. Svoboda, 2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03157-9). The success of lung cancer treatment and mortality reduction is directly related to the stage where cancer is diagnosed. The earlier it is diagnosed, the higher chances of survival. Unfortunately, lung cancer is usually diagnosed in the fourth stage. This problem motivates our work to improve CAD methods for early lung cancer diagnosis.
